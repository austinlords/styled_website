      	<p class="paragraph">
            Hello World! This is my first programming course and I'm loving it so far! Thanks
            <a href="http://www.udacity.com/" target="_blank">Udacity</a>!<br><br>
            I was born and raised in a small town in Western Montana. Sports were a huge part of my childhood: 
	    I played basketball, football, soccer, baseball and track. Today I satisfy my sports passion by 
	    following the NFL, NBA, riding my bike and playing pick-up basketball when I can.<br><br>
            I attended college at the University of San Diego where I studied Business Administration. 
	    I graduated in May 2017. One day I plan on owning my own business and being an entrepreneur. 
	    Recently I quit my job as a Tech Recruiter in NYC and am now exploring my options to pursue a 
	    career in computer programming. Baby steps!

      		    Following political news is a big hobby of mine; one that has grown immensely
		    since the election of Donald Trump. We are living in some interesting times! 
		    I keep up with political news by following news outlets, reporters, and politicians on Twitter. 
		    I also listen to podcasts and read the New York Times and the Washington Post.

      		    Programming is my latest interest! After working as a tech recruiter in NYC
		    for two months I was inspired to try programming myself. I like it much better 
		    than my old job, and would eventually like to make a career change!
